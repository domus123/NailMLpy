# NailMLpy
<h2> What is NailML </h2>
<p> Is a repository created for hosting simple machine learning codes
<p> This repo will be used for studying
<p> Anyone can feel free to contribute with ML codes 
<p>

<h3> What you need </h3>
<p> You will need :
<p> Python 2.7
<p> GraphLab : https://dato.com/products/create/ or numpy : http://www.numpy.org/
<p> Pandas : http://pandas.pydata.org/
<p> Jupyter Notebook : http://jupyter.org/

<h3> How to use </h3>
<p> Run the main code ipynb (ipython notebook)
<p> Shift + Enter will run the lines in jupyter notebook
<p> poft , just play as you want


<h3> Using numpy? </h3>
<p> If you're going to use numpy instead of GraphLab you will have to change some functions
<p> You can do this looking at this documentation from GraphLab website : https://dato.com/learn/translator/
